The <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> chat services allows you to chat with
users about a file. <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> displays an <i>avatar</i> for each user
with whom you share an open file. If you select <b>File/Chat ...</b> the
current notebook or program gets a chat window displayed below it,
preloaded with older chat messages about this file. The <a class="btn
btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a> button menu provides
advanced options such as including your query and <i>broadcasting</i>
to the shared help chat room (see below).
</p>

<h3 id="chat-help">The shared chat room</h3>

<p class="dropup">
The notebook <a href="/p/Help.swinb">Help.swinb</a> provides a place to
find buddies.  It can be opened from <b>File/Chat help room ...</b> and
messages may be cross-posted to this shared space using  <b>Cry for help</b>
from the <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a>
button.  The message that appears in the shared room contains a link to
the file from which it was created.
<p>

<h3 id="chat-status">Status of the SWISH sharing service</h3>

<p>
What you are seeing are the first steps to allow users of SWISH to communicate.
There are many facilities we have in mind, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect editors for collaborative editing
  <li>Make <i>teams</i> that connect people also if they are not editing
      the same file.
  <li>Allow Prolog programs to exchange messages through the chat room.
</ul>
